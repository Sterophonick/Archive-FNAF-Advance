This demake of FNaF is very similar to the mobile versions. Minor changes are:
very different control scheme
Removed usage counter
No door animation
No office animation
No fake perspective trick (clickteam only)
I'm sorry, but there is no camera moving. All camera versions are simply the GBA's native resolution, 240x160.
No Static for camera and title
No Fan animation
Lacking jumpscare framerate (cut down by half)
some Sounds Missing?
No mouse
Added Golden Freddy
Added Vision Hallucinations
C, and not Clickteam Fusion 2.5 (I wonder if I could find a GBA exporter...)
Golden Freddy resets the system, instead of just ending the application.
